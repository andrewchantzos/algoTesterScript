The scope of this bash script is to receive the folder with the test cases Dr Fotakis releases and an executable and print the 
differences between the program outputs and the correct ones (if there are any)
as well as the execution time for each test case.
#
The files of the folder with the testCases should not be changed!!!
It is assumed that the pairs of input-output will be in the form input$i.txt, output$i.txt
# Arguments
First argument: number of testCases in directory
#
Second argument: relative path to directory with testcases
#
Third argument: relative path to executable
